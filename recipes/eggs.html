    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>The crispy olive oil fried egg. These fried eggs have golden, lacy, crispy edges, which contrast beautifully with their runny yellow yolks. Contrast is everything!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with a great egg. I like to buy local eggs, which have the most beautiful golden yellow yolks. Free-range organic eggs are great, too. Cook one or two eggs at a time. I usually just cook one egg at a time in a small skillet because sometimes the two eggs cross paths and stick together.</li>
            <li>Crack the egg into a bowl first. You can more easily avoid oil splatters this way. I also find that pouring from a bowl yields a more evenly shaped fried egg that cooks a little more evenly.</li>
            <li>Make sure the oil is hot before you pour in the egg. This helps ensure that the egg doesnâ€™t stick to the bottom of the pan, and yields super crispy edges.</li>
            <li>If you want more firm yolks: For medium eggs, just cook the egg for 30 to 60 more seconds. If you want more firm yolks than that, you can cover the egg for 30 seconds or longer while it cooks.</li>
            <li>Season as desired. These fried eggs are basically perfect right out of the skillet, but I love to sprinkle them with a little flaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve them with a knife and a fork to cut through their crispy undersides!</li>
        </ul>
